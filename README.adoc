= asciidoctor-revealjs-klipse

Create slides from markdown that contain interactive code snippets.

See the link:slides.html[live example].

Notice that you can click into the code blocks and change them.
It re-evaluates the code on the fly.
This is handy for people who want to play around with your examples,
or if you just want nice syntax highlighting.


== About

This is a template project that shows how you can produce interactive slides.

The slides are generated using the
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs[Asciidoctor-revealjs]
converter.
You can read the documentation on how to create slides
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/#syntax-examples[here].

TLDR something like:

----
== Slide Title

Hello and welcome to my talk!

[source,eval-clojure]
(+ 1 2)


== Another Slide

Now for something a little different...


=== A Vertical Slide

[source,eval-clojure]
(inc 1)

----

You can see the source for the slides in this repo under
link:docs/slides.adoc[docs/slides.adoc].


== Dependencies

1. https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], a powerful toolchain for publishing
2. https://revealjs.com/[RevealJS], a slide deck generator
3. https://github.com/viebel/klipse[Klipse], an interactive client-side code evaluator.  

The key things required to integrate Klipse inside the slides are:

1. Load the Klipse javascript.
   Trigger a window resize event on slide transition.
   This causes CodeMirror to resize.
   Otherwise when future slides get loaded, the code area is height 0.
   (see link:docs/docinfo-footer.html[docs/docinfo-footer.html])
2. Avoid center aligning code and avoid scaling.
   (see link:docs/slide.attrs[docs/slide.attrs])
3. Override the `CodeMirror-cursor` and `CodeMirror-scroll` styles
   so that the cursor shows and clicking on the last line doesn't scroll weirdly.
   Also override `klipse-snippet` and `klipse-result` to make them stand out a little.
   (see end of link:site/slides.css[site/slides.css])


== Building

You'll need https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[Ruby]
and https://bundler.io[Bundler] installed.
If you prefer, you could also set up your own build based on
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/#node-javascript-setup[NodeJS].

    ./bb.sh

Gets dependencies and builds

    ./watch.sh

Builds, watches for changes, rebuilds


== Deploying

An automated TravisCI builds and deploys whenever changes are pushed to the master branch.
The automated deployment is configured in link:.travis.yml[.travis.yml].
See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/[Github Pages deployment with Travis].

It is also possible to build and deploy the site to github pages manually:

    ./deploy.sh
